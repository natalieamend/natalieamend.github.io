          <p>The dangers in Chicago's poor communities are deeper than the surface.<br>
            Many see Chicago as a dangerous place, mostly because of national coverage of the city's high homicide rate, gangs and gun violence occurring primarily in its poorer neighborhoods.<br>
            But poor neighborhoods in Chicago are in even more danger. According to the Chicago Department of Public Health, the city's five poorest communnity areas have a 60% higher chance of dying from all causes compared to the five least poor community areas. With homicide as the eighth-leading cause of death in the city, it's important to realize the bigger dangers that Chicago's poverished communities face.<br>
