	    	<h1>The Basics of Cocktails</h1>
	    	<p>The world of cocktails is a</p>
	    	<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
	    	<p>There are many ways to categorize cocktails. Below is a paraphrased version of a taxonomy from cocktail historian Paul Clarke.</a></p>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li><strong>Ancestrals:</strong> The basic formula of a spirit, bitters, sugar and water (normally as ice). Examples included the Old Fashioned, Manhattan, and Sazarec.</li>
	    		<li><strong>Spirit-Forward:</strong> Same base as an ancestral, but adding vermouth. Examples include Martinis, Negronis, and Bijous. </li>
	    		<li><strong>Duos and Trios:</strong> A duo has the same base as an ancestral, but adding a liqueur like cura√ßao or maraschino. Examples include the Alaska Cocktail and the Stinger. To turn a duo into a trio, you add a cream liqueur like Kahlua. A White Russian is an example of a trio.</li>
	    		<li><strong>Sours:</strong> A cocktail with both sweet and sour additions to the spirit and water components. The sour component is usually lemon or lime juice, but orange juice can be a component. Examples include margartias, sidecars, and daiquiris.</li>
	    		<li><strong>Champagne Cocktails:</strong> Typically has champagne as the largest base of the drink, which is poured on top of another drink, usually a sour. Examples include the French 75</strong></li>
	    		<li><strong>Highballs, Collins and Fizzes:</strong> A cocktail with non-alcoholic bubbles, like club soda or ginger ale, as its base. Highballs add juice or liquers to the base. Collins is a highball with lemon juice and sugar. Fizzes are the same thing as Collins, but the components are shaken (not stirred), strained and served without ice.</li>
	    		<li><strong>Juleps and Smashes:</strong> Cocktails with an emphasis on muddled fresh mint (if it's a julep) or fresh fruit (if it's a smash) and sugar served with ice. Examples include the Mint Julep and Whiskey Smash.</strong></li>
	    		<li><strong>Hot Drinks:</strong> Drinks served hot, obviously!</li>
	    		<li><strong>Flips and Nogs:</strong> Cocktails shaken with whole eggs. Examples include the Fort Washington Flip and the Colleen Bawn. The only different between nogs and flips is that nogs have milk or cream added.</li>
	    		<li><strong>Pousses:</strong> Cocktails that are layered, usually with syrups, for a distinctive appearance and are usually served in a shot glass. Popular in the 1980s, these don't make many appearances anymore, but some popular pousses are the B-52, the Buttery Nipple, and the Dirty Leprechaun. You can tell by these names that these were popular in the '80s.</li>
	    		<li><strong>Tiki:</strong> Usually made with rum but not exclusive to that spirit, these drinks are meant to evoke island vibes. Most tiki-style drinks are variations on the sour family with addition ingregients like orgeat (an almond syrup)</strong></li>
	    		<li><strong>Punches: Basically any cocktail prepared in bulk.</strong></li>
	    		<li><strong>Misc.:</strong> Whatever doesn't fit into the above categories. Think beer- and cider-based cocktails, wine-based cocktails Bloody Marys.</li>
	    	</ul>
	    	<h2>Formulas</h2>
	    	<p>A helpful tool for novice mixologists is seeing exact breakdowns of ingredients in drinks. For example, ancestral cocktails have the following components:</p>
	    	<ol>
	    		<li>Spirit</li>
	    		<li>Bitters</li>
	    		<li>Sugar</li>
	    		<li>Water</li>
	    	</ol>
	    	<p>Ratios vary for most drinks, but see below for common ratios in ancestrals. As you saw in the taxonomy, knowing an ancestral is an open door for experimenting with other families of drinks.</p>
			<table border="1" width="60%">
				<tr>
					<th>Cocktail</th>
					<th>Spirit</th>
					<th>Bitters</th>
					<th>Sugar</th>
					<th>Water</th>
				</tr>
				<tr align="center">
					<th>Old Fashioned</th>
					<td>2 oz. bourbon or rye whiskey</td>
					<td>2 dashes Angostura bitters</td>
					<td>One sugar cube or 1 tsp. sugar</td>
					<td>Ice</td>
				</tr>
				<tr align="center">
					<th>Manhattan</th>
					<td>Bourbon</td>
					<td>Angostura bitters</td>
					<td>Sweet vermouth</td>
					<td>Ice</td>
				</tr>
				<tr align="center">
					<th>Sazerac</th>
					<td>Rye whiskey</td>
					<td>Peychaud's bitters</td>
					<td>Sugar</td>
					<td>Ice</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
	    	<p>Sours, in my opinon, are the second most important family to master. Sours are all about balancing different types of taste. The basic components of a sour are the following:</p>
	    	<ol>
	    		<li>Spirit</li>
	    		<li>Sugar</li>
	    		<li>Sour</li>
	    		<li>Water</li>
	    	</ol>
	    	<p>Some common sours are below. An important tip to making any cocktail, but especially a sour, is to taste the drink before you serve it. You can usually tell if a sour tastes "off" right away, and you can fix it by adding more of the opposite ingredient. For example, if it tastes too sweet, add some more lime juice or rum. If it tastes too sour, add more simple syrup.</p>
			<table border="1" width="50%">
				<tr>
					<th>Cocktail</th>
					<th>Spirit</th>
					<th>Sweet</th>
					<th>Sour</th>
					<th>Water</th>
				</tr>
				<tr align="center">
					<th>Whiskey Sour</th>
					<td>Whiskey</td>
					<td>Simple syrup</td>
					<td>Lemon juice</td>
					<td>Ice</td>
				</tr>
				<tr align="center">
					<th>Daiquiri</th>
					<td>Rum</td>
					<td>Simple syrup</td>
					<td>Lime juice</td>
					<td>Ice</td>
				</tr>
				<tr align="center">
					<th>Daiquiri</th>
					<td>Rum</td>
					<td>Simple syrup</td>
					<td>Lime juice</td>
					<td>Ice</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
	    	<h2>Shake or Stir?</h2>
	    	<p>The general rule of thumb for bringing together a cocktail is the following:</p>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li><strong>Stir</strong> a cocktail when it is predominately made of spirits and/or very light mixers. An example would be a martini, which has gin and vermouth, or a negroni, which consists of gin, Campari and sweet vermouth. These drinks may also have a muddling component, like the Old Fashioned, whose first step is muddling together bitters and sugar.</li>
	    		<li><strong>Shake</strong> a cocktail when it has more flavorful and thicker mixtures, like fruit/citrus juices, simple syrup, eggs or dairy. A Daiquiri, for example, needs to be shaken so the lime juice and simple syrup blend together with the rum.</li>
